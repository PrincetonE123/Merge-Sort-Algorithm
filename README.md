# Merge-Sort-Algorithm
This program is ran by first presenting the user with an interface which asked the user to select an array (1-9), and which ever number they select, will be the array that is chosen. The original array is then displayed, and then the sorted array is then displayed. The time is also calculated and displayed. The program must be re-run in order to first the unsorted array before seeing the sorted one. This is because once the array is sorted, it will remain sorted even after the user selects another array. All the information is then placed in a CSV spreadsheet file by the program. *Note* you must change the path to match your computer so that the program can create the CSV file on your computer. The excel spreadsheet is generated by the program.
